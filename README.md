## Before Running or Building:

In the project directory, run 'yarn install'. Dependencies include [echarts for react](https://git.hust.cc/echarts-for-react/), [echarts](https://yarnpkg.com/package/echarts), [typescript](https://yarnpkg.com/package/typescript), [react](https://yarnpkg.com/package/react) and [react-dom](https://yarnpkg.com/package/react-dom). Make sure all dependencies are installed. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
